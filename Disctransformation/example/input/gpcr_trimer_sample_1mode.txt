#ARG(1):Number of Disc, N (discs will be labeled 0..(N-1))
#ARG(2):Radius of Discs
#ARG(3):Overlap distanvce or Distance between the circumference of the discs. Distance between disc centres would hence be = (2*radius + specified distance). Negative numbers would make the discs to overlap.
#ARG(4): Add label to each disc (Yes/No)
#ARG(5): List of Modes of association: Mode name (column 1), rotation of disc x about its radius vector (column 2), rotation of disc y about its radius vector (column 3), Relative arrangement of the discs, 1 for parallel and 0 for anti-parallel (column 4), Relative axial distance between disc (third dimension) (column 5). Each disc can have multiple neighbours. The program will NOT check for logical consistency of the relative placement of disc, for example, confliciting assignments of neighbours - in which case the last neighbour assignment overwites previous records.   
#ARG(6): Square Adjacency matrix providing the connections between discs numbered from 0 to N-1. 
#ARG(7): Output file for printing the model for visualization.
#ARG(8): Maximum distance between two disc centers for possible interaction. This will be used to identify new interactions that might happen.  This includes 2*ARG(2)+ARG(3)+relaxtion distance. Default value is 50 having relaxation distance 5 units
#ARG(9): Minimum distance allowed between any two discs centers. Below that any distance will be treated as clash. This can be taken as (2 * radius - overlapp% of radius). For example: for radius 27 and overlapp percentage as 50% of along the radius. Then arg(7) is (2*27- 0.5*27)=40.5
#ARG(10): Unique identifier to be used during sampling to identify the best model. 


#ARGUMENTS @ARG11 to @ARG16 will be skipped for single runs. These arguments are used for automated sampling
#ARG(11): Maximum Disc overlap fraction for starting configurations for smapling. For instance, With radius=20 and overlap fraction = 0.5, indicates starting disc configuration will overlap 50% of disc.
#ARG(12): Rotation step for each disc for sampling.
#ARG(13): Translation step for each disc til disc overlap is zero during sampling.
#ARG(14): (yes/no) Save Disc Models for All samples; Avoid slow.
#ARG(15): (yes/no) Save PDB Models for All samples; Avoid very slow.
#ARG(16): (yes/no) Save Disctransformation Input files for All samples; This file can be used after sampling to generate PDB models for best configuration.
